# NemaMotorRpmEstimation
Here are 4 models used to estimate the rpm of a Nema stepper motor from the sound it makes.
- Kernel logistic regression (KernelLogisticRegressionExploration.ipynb)
- Kernel logistic classification (KernelLogisticClassificationExploration.ipynb)
- Perceptron multilayer (MPLS_MLP.ipynb)
- Audio Spectrogram Transformer (ASTModelImplementation 3.ipynb)
